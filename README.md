# Front-end Developer Test
Using either Vue (preferably) or React framework, build a star wars directory using [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/), which has all api endpoints required for the application.

## Website layout
We've created a design for you to use to build your site. Layout files can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/Ml2ObxlLrFkQMyTfWWkI6w/Star_wars?node-id=0%3A1)
- this should only serve as a guide for what your final site should try as much as possible to replicate
- the images visible in the design above for Characters/Starships/Planets cannot (unfortunately) be gotten from the [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/), as it doesn't provide images in it's responses. Because of this, we've provided an assets folder with images you can use instead. 

**Note:** The assets provided (with the exception of the logo and hero-banner) are simply placeholder images to help your site look/feel more complete in the _'Popular Starships'_ and _'Starwars Characters'_ pages. We do **not** expect you to programmatically map characters/ships to their respective images in those pages. We do however expect you to try to replicate the _home page_ as much as possible.

## General requirements
A single page application using either Vue (preferably) or React featuring:
- A visually pleasing experience, you don‚Äôt have to be a designer but you must have put an effort into making this look good
- A "componentized" approach, split your code into small building blocks, showcase your clean architecture skills.
- CSS should be written using a CSS preprocessor like SCSS, PostCSS, LESS or similar higher-level language
