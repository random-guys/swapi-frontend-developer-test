# Front-end Developer Test
Using either Vue (preferably) or React framework, build a star wars directory using [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/), which has all api endpoints required for the application.

## Website layout
We've created a design for you to use to build your site. Layout files can be found [here](https://scene.zeplin.io/project/5d6d23a6683e59b8beab5dcd)
- this should only serve as a guide for what your final site should try as much as possible to replicate
- the images visible in the design above for Characters/Starships/Planets cannot (unfortunately) be gotten from the [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/), as it doesn't provide images in it's responses. Because of this, we've provided an assets folder with images you can use instead. 

**Note:** The assets provided (with the exception of the logo and hero-banner) are simply placeholder images to help your site look/feel more complete in the _'Popular Starships'_ and _'Starwars Characters'_ pages. We do **not** expect you to programmatically map characters/ships to their respective images in those pages. We do however expect you to try to replicate the _home page_ as much as possible.

## General requirements
A single page application using either Vue (preferably) or React featuring:
- A visually pleasing experience, you don’t have to be a designer but you must have put an effort into making this look good
- A "componentized" approach, split your code into small building blocks, showcase your clean architecture skills.
- CSS can be written using PostCSS, SASS, LESS or similar higher-level language
- Responsive design
  
## Functional requirements
- User can view a list of people (humans & robots), list item should contain full name, birth year and gender
